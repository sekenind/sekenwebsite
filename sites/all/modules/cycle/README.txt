## Introduction

This module makes the jQuery Cycle library available to your Drupal site via the
Libraries API module, and it also provides a field formatter. The field
formatter allows you to output several field types as a slideshow.


## Requirements

This module requires both the Libraries API module and the jQuery Cycle Plugin.

The Libraries API module can be downloaded from
https://www.drupal.org/project/libraries. Make sure to use a current stable
version from the 7.x-2.x branch.

The jQuery Cycle Plugin can be downloaded from
http://jquery.malsup.com/cycle/download.html, but the minified version is at
http://malsup.github.io/min/jquery.cycle.all.min.js


## Installation

1. Install the module the [drupal way].
2. Install the [Libraries module].
3. Download the jQuery Cycle Plugin from
   http://malsup.github.io/min/jquery.cycle.all.min.js and place it in a
   directory named 'cycle' in your site's sites/all/libraries directory.
3. Go to *Manage display* and choose *Cycle* as formatter and set the settings.
